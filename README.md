# Space Tourism Website

This is a multi-paged website implemented with ReactJs.

Since React is a Single Page Application, I made use of one of the many react components, "React-Router-Dom" to route through the different pages and also display the corresponding data on those pages.

The different pages has various tabs which when clicked displays dynamic data based on the button that was clicked.

The data on the different pages was gotten from a json file as contained in the reppo.

To view the live page, clicke <a href='https://Nathaniyell.github.io/Space-Tourism' target='_blank'>Here</a>
